Hi, I'm Filip Cristian, and I'd like to tell you about my Videogames MarketPlace project. This is a comprehensive ecommerce platform designed specifically for video game enthusiasts. The primary goal of this project was to delve into full-stack development, focusing on both backend and frontend technologies.

### Purpose and Goals
The project aims to create an innovative online marketplace where users from all over the world can sell their video games. My focus is on providing a user-friendly experience, with secure payment options and efficient delivery services. Ultimately, I aim to build a dynamic community where gamers can easily buy, sell, and trade their favorite titles.

### Technology Stack
  - **Backend**: I used Java Spring for its robustness and scalability. Key features include:
  - **Spring Boot**: For rapid application development and deployment.
  - **Spring Data**: For seamless database interaction.
  - **Spring Security**: To ensure robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- **Frontend**: The frontend was developed using React.js, which allowed me to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM made it ideal for my needs.

- **Database**: I chose MySQL for its reliability and performance. It serves as the backbone for storing user information, product details, orders, and more.

### Project Architecture
My architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. I used Spring Data JPA for ORM.
- **View**: Built with React, it handles the presentation layer.
- **Controller**: Manages the communication between the Model and View, using Spring MVC.

### Functional Requirements
The platform includes several key features:
1. **User Registration and Login**: Secure and straightforward registration and login processes with encrypted password storage.
2. **Spring Security Integration**: Comprehensive security measures to protect against unauthorized access.
3. **Email Validation**: Ensures the authenticity of user-provided email addresses during registration.

### Use Case and Domain Models
I created use case diagrams to illustrate the interactions between users and the system. The domain model includes various classes such as User, Product, Order, and Review, each with their respective relationships.

### Component and Deployment Diagrams
My component diagram outlines the structure and interactions of different parts of the system, while the deployment diagram shows the setup of my web server, application server, and database server.

### Dynamic Behavior
I detailed the dynamic behavior of the system with sequence and communication diagrams, highlighting processes like user login and product addition.


### Conclusion
In conclusion, the Videogames MarketPlace project leverages a diverse array of technologies to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for buying and selling video games. By combining Java Spring, React, and MySQL, I've created a robust system that meets the needs of users while providing a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack development.

### References
I've used resources such as the React documentation, Spring framework documentation, and JUnit user guides, among others, to support this project.

I'm excited about the potential of this project and the skills I've gained from working on it. I'm eager to bring this experience to a new role and continue growing in the field of software development.
